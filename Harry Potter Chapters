--For some reason, the Movie ID was yielding part of the Chapter names.
--Upon further investigation, I discovered that the column is being split in comma separated strings.

--To fix this, I decided to update the table and set the correct values for the row. Let's see what happens!

UPDATE harrypotter.dbo.Chapters
SET [Chapter Name] = 'Flesh, Blood and Bone'
WHERE [Chapter ID] = 126;

UPDATE harrypotter.dbo.Chapters
SET [Chapter Name] = 'Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place', [Movie ID] = 5
WHERE [Chapter ID] = 133;

UPDATE harrypotter.dbo.Chapters
SET [Chapter Name] = 'Preserve, Perfect and Prune', [Movie ID] = 5
WHERE [Chapter ID] = 139;

UPDATE harrypotter.dbo.Chapters
SET [Chapter Name] = 'Truly Seen, Truly Free', [Movie ID] = 3
WHERE [Chapter ID] = 100;

SELECT DISTINCT [Movie ID]
FROM harrypotter.dbo.Chapters;

--Yields:

--IT WORKED! It took me a little while to figure out the issue (and my handy friend Google was also my silent helper), but I managed to fix the problem.

SELECT [Movie ID] AS "Movie Number", COUNT(*)
FROM harrypotter.dbo.Chapters
GROUP BY [Movie ID]
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--Yields:
Movie Number  Number of Chapters
2           	36
1           	34
3           	33
4           	27
5           	27
6           	26
8	            26
7	            25

--It looks like Movie 2 (Chamber of Secrets) had the most Chapters, followed closely by Movie 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) and Movie 3 (Prisoner of Azkaban).
