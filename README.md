# DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

On my path to becoming a data analyst, I decided that the best way to explore and showcase my skills is by getting my hands dirty and working directly with databases.

I've completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate through Coursera/Google and am currently working on Alex Freberg's (also known as Alex the Analyst) Data Analyst Bootcamp on YouTube. I hope to include some interesting projects/insights for your perusal.
