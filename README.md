# DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

On my path to becoming a data analyst, I decided that the best way to explore and showcase my skills is by getting my hands dirty and working directly with databases.

I decided to use Maven Analytics as the source of data at this time, particularly because their team helps guide people to a new path in technology.
Plus, they have a Harry Potter database. How could I pass up that opportunity to work with a dataset focused on magic? 

In any case, I decided to apply what I've learned by using actual databases, investigating patterns, and seeing if I can find any interesting conclusions.
I hope that this portfolio will display my skills and proficiency, particularly with SQL, in the hopes that I will be one step closer to my career as a data analyst.
