# DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

On my path to becoming a data analyst, I decided that the best way to explore and showcase my skills is by getting my hands dirty and working directly with databases.

I've been utilizing datasets from Maven Analytics and Kaggle to delve into the 'analysis' portion of my skills. I hope that, through these projects, I will be able to show my growth and understanding of this field, as well as offer some insight into some of the datasets I'll be looking at.
