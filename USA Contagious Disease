--KAGGLE DATASET: usa_contagious_disease

--I decided to put my SQL skills into practice using real datasets. I'm utilizing BigQuery for analyzing a dataset (usa_contagious_disease) available on Kaggle.
--This public data is from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
--It includes all weekly surveillance reports of nationally notifiable diseases for all U.S. cities and states published between 1888 and 2013. 
--The data set consists of eight important vaccine-preventable contagious diseases: diphtheria, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, pertussis, polio, rubella and smallpox.

SELECT state, disease, COUNT(cases)
FROM practice-projects-380814.usa_contagious_disease.project_tycho_reports
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(cases) > 1000
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

--Yields: 
'''
MA  DIPHTHERIA - 7616
WI - DIPHTHERIA - 6780
TX - DIPHTHERIA - 6548
NY - DIPHTHERIA - 6505
OH - DIPHTHERIA - 6140

--Obviously, diphetheria is prominent, so I decided to group the contagious diseases by total number through the US instead to see if that yielded anything differently.

SELECT disease, COUNT(cases)
FROM practice-projects-380814.usa_contagious_disease.project_tycho_reports
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--Yields:

Diphtheria - 158983

--Since I live in MI, I decided to see what diseases, and how many cases, affected MI specifically.

SELECT disease, COUNT(cases)

WHERE state = 'MI'
GROUP BY 1
