--Utilized Covid Death/Vaccination Data from the following site: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

--Looking at Total Cases vs. Total Deaths
--Had to change data types to float/int, as they were saved as nvarchar

SELECT Location, Date, total_cases, total_deaths, (CAST(total_deaths AS float)/CAST(total_cases AS float)) * 100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM CovidDeaths
WHERE Location LIKE '%states%'
ORDER BY 1,2

--Looking at Total Cases vs. Population
SELECT Location, Date, population, total_cases, (CAST(total_cases AS float)/population) * 100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM CovidDeaths
WHERE Location LIKE '%states%' 
ORDER BY 1,2

--Looking at Countries with Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population

SELECT Location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, MAX(CAST(total_cases AS float)/population) * 100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Location, population
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC

--Showing Countries with the Highest Death Count Per Population

SELECT Location, population, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS HighestDeathCount, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)/population) * 100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Location, population
ORDER BY DeathPercentage DESC

--Looking into Total Deaths by Continent

SELECT continent, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC
