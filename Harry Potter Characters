--Okay, let's dive into the different Houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Is there a relation between gender and the House?

--Gryffindor and Slytherin are primarily male-dominant from the Character list, while Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff have equal distributions of male and female.
--Of note, there were 41 Characters that had empty House and Gender columns, but 21 are non-human (as above) and therefore would not be included in this calculation.
--There were also 35 males and 15 females that were not assigned to a House, so this is something to consider in the final numbers.
--But what is this "Human" value instead of a Gender? Investigation of the dataset showed that "Nearly Headless Nick" was not assigned a gender.
--For any avid Harry Potter fan, we know that Nearly Headless Nick is male, so let's update the table!

UPDATE harrypotter.dbo.Characters
SET [Gender] = 'Male'
WHERE [Character ID] = 47;

SELECT [House], [Gender], COUNT(*)
FROM harrypotter.dbo.Characters
GROUP BY [House], [Gender]
HAVING [House] <> '' AND [Gender] <> ''
AND [House] <> 'Durmstrang Institute' AND [House] <> 'Beauxbatons Academy of Magic'
ORDER BY 3 DESC;


--Yields:
Gryffindor	Male	22
Slytherin	Male	14
Gryffindor	Female	9
Ravenclaw	Female	6
Slytherin	Female	6
Ravenclaw	Male	6
Hufflepuff	Male	4
Hufflepuff	Female	4

--That looks much better! I'd also like to point out that Durmstrang and Beauxbatons aren't technically Houses, so I removed those for accuracy's sake.
